The Bonn Spatial Memory Lab (@BonnSpatialMemoryLab) is a neuroscience laboratory at the Department of Epileptology of the University of Bonn Medical Center.

We are interested in spatial memory in humans and its neural foundations. We are always looking for scientific exchange and new collaborators.
